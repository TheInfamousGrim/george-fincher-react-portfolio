## Description

I had to use lots of different technologies to get this bad boy off the ground. I got to understand how state and hooks work in React., the benefits or running a single page application as well as how to do client side routing.

### User Story üë§

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### What did I Learn üè´

There was a lot that I learned. I also learned the benefits of using something like vite instead of CRA as it's much faster!

I also learned how to use:

- React hooks
- React props.
- React Router.
- Email.js.
- and much more!.
